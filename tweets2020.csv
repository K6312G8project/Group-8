1698,2020-06-16 11:57:38+00:00,1069951303994863616,@AdamKirkEdge I'm very happy for LGBT rights progression in the U.S. But it is still like that in Asia.

1, abolish caning. 

2, abolish 377A. 

3, legalize same sex marriage. 

4, legalize euthanasia. 

5, legalize porn industry. 

Until all these are done, I will always vote PAP out."
